## Wireframe
### Wireframe 1.0
The first draft of the wireframe was created early in the process of the project. This wireframe includes website functionalites as well as design choises. The theme color on the first draft of the website was chosen to be red. This was not an optimal choise, and was changed later in the process. The color red is often assosiated with strong feelings, such as love, anger or alerts as well as warnings. For this purple, the color red was not optimal since course selection should not envoke strong feelings.
