# Design Guidelines for Learniverse Connect

## Introduction
This is the design guidelines for the web-application Learniverse Connect. The first part of the guidelines take 
inspiration from "Design Guidelines" provided by lecturer in Blackboard., while the other part takes inspirations 
from Don Norman's usability principles.

## Design Guide checklist
This checklist will be compared to the wireframes and design ideas throughout the time of the project. These wireframes
vary, and therefore the design guidelines was refactored. 

### Concept phase
In the concept phase, before writing code, you should decide the general rules and direction:
1. The **theme** for Learniverse Connect should be professional. This to encourage serious learners to apply for 
a course through this website. 
2. The first wireframes **color scheme** is inspired by other course providing website, such as UIA (https://www.uia.no/) 
and UIB(https://www.uib.no/). Both websites use red as its primary color.
3. The website focuses on **hierarchy and layout**. The most important message on the website should be the courses
the website provides. The website should have different pages, with different purposes and therefore different messages. 
The homepage should show popular courses while all courses will be shown in a different page called *courses*. The idea
behind this is to make the homepage easily accessible for viewers, while users who are more interested can visit the 
course page for more detailed information. The different sections of a page should include a navigation bar with a 
hamburger menu, a main part and a footer. The main parts layout varies from page to page, where the login and signup 
for example should have a form for the user to fill out. 
4. All the **images** used in the website should be stored in a folder. These images include course cover images and
profile pictures. 

### Sketch phase

### Specific technical decisions
1. The **color** of purple (#9758a3) is the main color of the website, while different gradients of the same 
color becomes its accent color. There is no specific shadows/tints used on the website. Changed from concept phase 
where the color is red. This because red is a strong color, and the website may feel aggressive and unwelcoming. 
Learniverse Connect should have a balance of both professionalism and approachability. The website should feel 
inviting, easy to use and professional. This to encourage user to engage with the site.
2. The **typography** includes the font and size of the different 
   * p - with a font size 14px
   * h1 - inherit font size 2em, 2 times the current font size. 
   * h2 - inherit font size 16 px
   * h3 - inherit font size 1.17em

## Conclusion
By adhering to these design guidelines, we aim to create a user-friendly and accessible web application that provides a 
delightful experience for all users. Consistency, clarity, and accessibility are at the core of our design philosophy, 
and we encourage all team members to follow these principles in their design and development efforts.
