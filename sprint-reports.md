Discussion: 

We have created a basic react application where the user can go between different webpages. The group decided to create a react application early on as we thought it would lessen the amount of code having to be refactored. The largest issue is figuring out what we should focus on and spend our time on. We don’t know how the application is going to communicate with the front-end, how to connect the database to the application, how to use APIs and so on. Our concern is that if we begin creating something there might be another way easier method which would mean we wasted our time.
