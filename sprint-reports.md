# Sprints 

## Week 7: 

Date: 15 February  
Participants: Vegard Arnesen Mytting, Øystein Grande, Chris Sivert Sylte, Birgitte Vik 

### What was accomplished: 

* Started on a wireframe 
* Installed MySQL on OpenStack server 
* Begun creating front-end webpages 
* Added basic search bar 
* Added routing between pages 
* Added some images 

 

### What didn’t go well: 

* Confusion using Node.js (npm) 
* Confusion when pushing and making different branches 
* Disagreement on what to work on/do 

 

### What to do: 

* Create web design guidelines 
* Connect database to the application 
* Make website more visually pleasing
 - Add effects
 - Center elements and text

## Discussion: 
We have created a basic react application where the user can go between different webpages. The group decided to create a react application early on as we thought it would lessen the amount of code having to be refactored. The largest issue is figuring out what we should focus on and spend our time on. We don’t know how the application is going to communicate with the front-end, how to connect the database to the application, how to use APIs and so on. Our concern is that if we begin creating something there might be another way easier method which would mean we wasted our time. 

## Week 9

Date: 29 February  
Participants: Vegard Arnesen Mytting, Øystein Grande, Chris Sivert Sylte, Birgitte Vik 

### What was accomplished: 

* Connected database
* Some improvement on styling
* Improved project strucutre, more concise and removed
unecessary files


### What didn’t go well: 

* Not too much work has been done
* Unclear what to do and work on

### What to do: 

* Convert flowchart to use-case
* Imporve/expand upon database schema
* Clean up file strucutre
* Øystein currently taking a course and will update the
website continuously
* Chris Sivert focuses on communicating with the database
and making front-end elements retrieve necessary information
* Vegard works on hamburgermenu and header
* Birgitte works on front-end overall


## Discussion: 
Each person works on their indivudal page to avoid merge conflicts. Important to remember to divide the work among the group memebers on both front-end and back-end. As of now we continue working on front-end, Chris Sivert will attempt to make the front-end be able to retrieve information from the database. We feel as we are waiting for the lecture to move on. Now we only create styling but have no functionality.
